*NOTE:* This website project uses SCSS, you will need to npm install to get the
dependencies necessary to watch for changes in `.scss` files, which get processed
into the `.css` this site uses.

*Don't* try to edit the `.css` files directly :)

Quickstart

`npm install`

Watch SCSS changes

`npm run watch-scss`
